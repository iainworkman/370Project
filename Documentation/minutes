1.
 Coding conventions
 Iain expressed his annoyance with the get/set ideas.
 We should use the Java style guides:
 Classes: SomeClass INterfaces the same
 Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase,
 with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.
 Variables: All have meaning, camel case. 
 0Except loop counters: 
  vector<widgets> widgetCollection
  for (widget currentWidget:widgetCollection) 
Unless unavoidable
Git Conventions:
Branches: 
  Iain has in the past used a 1:1 ratio with issues and branches, but that might not work while we're building 
 In dicussing the conventions it was suggested that we do the web applet as a prototype for the localO
Only other Git things:
git pull origin master: It updates to the most recent version, always do this before starting to work
commit after you're done, but only push if it's tested
