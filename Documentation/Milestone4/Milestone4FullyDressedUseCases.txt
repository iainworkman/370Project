Use Case Name: Producer Adds Scene To Schedule 
Scope: Primary Volunteer Scheduling Application
Primary Actor: Producer
Stakeholders and Interests: 
- Producer: Wants to be able to schedule to scene to be shot in an appropriate time for all their volunteers. They want access to all the information on when the scene can be shot, fitting around the limited availabilities of the volunteers and equipment which the scene requires. The resposibility of the producer is to ensure that the film is fully shot in as short a time period as possible, so having access to information and feedback on the times which scenes can be shot is imperative.
- Volunteer: Wants to be involved in the filming process at times that suit them. Is invested in the success of the film and as such wishes to see the film completed. Is giving over their own free time, so wishes to see the film completed in a short a window of time as possible, so as not to have the film unduly interfere with their daily lives.
- Film Company: Outside of the producer and the volunteers there are also a number of people involved in the creation of the film (writers, executive producers etc.), who might not be listed specifically as volunteers for the purpose of the system, but are still heavily invested in the success of the film.
Preconditions:
- The script which the scene belongs to has been created
- The scene the producer wishes to schedule has been created and added to the script
- The scene has not already been shot
Postconditions:
- The script is added to the schedule at the time specified
- The producer is provided with feedback regarding whether or not the scene can be filmed at this date, given the availabilities of the volunteers and equipment it contains
Summary: The Producer wishes to schedule the date and time which a scene will be filmed. The Producer switches to the 'Scheduling' tab, which displays a list of all the scenes, plus a monthly calendar view centred on the current month, which displays the current shooting schedule. The Producer then Right-Clicks the appropriate date on the calendar and selects 'Schedule Scene' from the context menu which appears. This will open a small dialog window, defaulting to the date which was under focus when the Producer Right-Clicked. The Producer can then select a Scene from a list, and alter the date-time when it will be shot. The Producer can then click 'Okay' which will add the scene to that date in the schedule, or 'Cancel' to back out of the operation. After the scene is added to the schedule, the schedule is then validated to ensure that no conflicts of availability have arisen from the change in the schedule.
