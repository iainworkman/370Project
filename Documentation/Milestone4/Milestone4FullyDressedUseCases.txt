Use Case Name: Add Scene To Schedule 

Summary: The Producer wishes to schedule the date and time which a scene will be filmed. The Producer switches to the 'Scheduling' tab, which displays a list of all the scenes, plus a monthly calendar view centred on the current month, which displays the current shooting schedule. The Producer then Right-Clicks the appropriate date on the calendar and selects 'Schedule Scene' from the context menu which appears. This will open a small dialog window, defaulting to the date which was under focus when the Producer Right-Clicked. The Producer can then select a Scene from a list, and alter the date-time when it will be shot. The Producer can then click 'Okay' which will add the scene to that date in the schedule, or 'Cancel' to back out of the operation. After the scene is added to the schedule, the schedule is then validated to ensure that no conflicts of availability have arisen from the change in the schedule.
