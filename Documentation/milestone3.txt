Movie Scheduler
by Achieveatron Unlimited


Product Description


Business Case

A significant amount of the responsibility for the organisation of a movie project falls to the producer, once a shooting begins. It is up to them to decide when each scene should be shot, keep track of progress on the film, inform the required cast and crew of when they will be required, ensure that all the necessary equipment (lighting, cameras, microphones, generators) is present for any given scene, and keep everything flowing on any given day of filming. This workload is increased significantly when producing a movie which is reliant of volunteers or volunteered equipment and has, to some extent, to work itself around their schedules. 

In order to ease the complexity of this task of orginaization our firm will design and build a piece of software which will assist in the collection of all the information needed to build a shooting itinerary for an entire movie project, including the scenes to be shot, the volunteers who will form the cast and crew, the equipment needed to be shot and the volunteer/equipment requirements of the scenes. With this information the producer will have a visual and automatic means of bringing together this information into a workable itinerary. The system will also facilitiate communication between the producer and the volunteers by allowing the emailing of all relevant parties required for given scenes (in the case, for instance, of an unworkable itinerary), and will feature a web applet that will allow the volunteers to update their information from across the web, should their availability or contact info change.

User Level Goals


User Scenarios


In our project we have identified one major use case and one minor use case. The primary users will be one or more producers who's primary uses of the software will be to organize scheduling and resolving conflicts involving volunteers/equipment. The secondary use of the software will be for volunteers to easily edit contact info and availability to resolve conflicts.

Use Case: Enter new volunteer/equipment information
Actors: Producers
Goal: To enter new information into the database regarding equipment and volunteer availabilities
Activity: A producer receives a form with the volunteer's skills as they relate to the film, their availability and contact information. They also receive equipment rental information time availability They then are able to quickly enter it in large quantities. 
Quality: Must be efficient, and accurate

Use Case: Enter/Edit scene requirements 
Actors: Producers
Goal: Allow the producers to check off what type of people and equipment is needed for a particular scene, so that a schedule can be generated. It should also allow the editing of requirements.
Quality: Efficient and simple

Use Case: Edit/Update Information
Actors: Producers/Volunteers
Goal: Allow the editing of volunteer/equipment availbility by the producer or the Volunteers through the web service
Quality: Reliable, simple, and consistent

Use Case: Schedule Generation
Actors: Producers
Goal: Once the volunteer availability and scene requirements are input, allow a spreadsheet or other document to be produced that shows what time different scenes will be filmed at.
Quality: Must 100% correct, concise as possible and reliable.

Use Case: Conflict resolution
Actors: Producers
Goal: Allow the producers to view conflicts, and make decisions, such as to send everyone involved emails, or to generate a list of their phone numbers.
Quality:  Reliable and simple (For the user)
